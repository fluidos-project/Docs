# Two nodes in different domains, with catalog

The complete workflow showing the interaction between two nodes belonging to different domains is the following.

NOTE: there are ongoing discussions whether the 'catalog' concept can be considered a slighty special node (i.e., with some missing components, while others are characterized by a more sophisticated processing logic) and the workflow referred to this case can be seamlessly integrated in the one already defined in the other ones.
